                in with your friends in the crystal clear water and experience
                the fine white sand below your feets here in Marson's Beach
                Resort located at Lavezares, Northern Samar. It's simple in
                style and quality but you can see that it's still in
                development. It is one of the less visited resorts in the island
                because it is in a secluded area, far from the northern beaches
                of Lavezares, Northern Samar, about 8 kilometers from the main
                road and . But once you reach Marson's Beach Resort, you will be
                pleased by the relaxing ambiance and wonderful trees that
                surrounds it.
